Project Title: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Network Analytics

Introduction:

Rapid developments in financial information, technology, and communication have facilitated the movement of money anywhere in the world with speed and ease. This makes the task of combating money laundering more urgent than ever. Every year, US$800 billion to US$2 trillion is laundered. This is about 2−5 percent of the global GDP.3 To address this challenge, governments and regulators across the world have come up with legislation and guidelines that have evolved over the years. AML compliance for banks is no longer a standalone function but one that is increasingly complex. Its scope covers functions such as legal, risk, operations, and tax. With ignorance no longer being excused, minimum compliance with regulatory obligations is no longer enough.

Background:

Recent years have witnessed a growing number of highly publicized money laundering scandals involving major international providers of diversified financial services and their correspondents in ‘‘off-shore’’ jurisdictions, such as Russia, other former Soviet Republics, Latin America and the Caribbean (IFAC, 2002). In response, governments and legal authorities in various jurisdictions have issued an accelerated level of pronouncements and taken other enforcement steps focused on combating ML and related financial crime. In 1989, the Group of Seven Industrial Democracies (G-7) created a global ML watchdog organization called the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In 1990, the FATF issued its first annual report, containing its FATF 40 Recommendations, which are a most important set of international AML standards and they have been a substantial motivation in facilitating government AML initiatives. An important element and theme of the FATF 40 Recommendations is the know Your Customer (KYC) or enhanced due diligence principles. KYC guidelines require or recommend developing a keen understanding, through appropriate due diligence, of whom the true beneficial owners and parties to transactions are, the source and intended use of funds and the appropriateness and reasonableness of the business activity and pattern of transactions in the context of business (IFAC, 2002). In addition, FATF also recommended implementing Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) models, record keeping, and AML controls as part of overall AML regimes.

Description of Problem:

Money laundering has potentially devastating economic, security, and social consequences. It provides the fuel for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials, and others to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. Criminal elements in today’s technology-driven society are using every means available at their disposal to launder the proceeds from their illegal activities. While many anti-money laundering (AML) solutions have been in place for some time within the financial community, they face the challenge to adapt to the ever-changing risk and methods in relation to money laundering (ML).

Network Analytics:

Network analytics in the real world
Network analytics examines the connections between related entities to better illuminate relationships. Instead of analyzing an individual, subcomponents of the network are reviewed for similarity to known methods of money laundering and atypical customer behavior.
Networks are formed by links between customers and related activity. These (sometimes inferred) links can be internal data, such as account transfers or joint ownership, or external data, such as a shared address or common use of the same ATM.
Network analytics compliments existing machine learning and fuzzy logic-based approaches that many banks use for AML monitoring. Network statistics (for example, connectivity) for each customer can be used as an input to improve the accuracy of customer risk rating or transaction monitoring models. Fuzzy logic-based approaches that resolve customer identities can also be improved by looking at how closely accounts are connected. In addition to improving the effectiveness of existing techniques, network analytics provides investigators with new capabilities. For example, community detection algorithms can identify the presence of customer groups that could be indicative of criminal behavior.

BENEFITS OF NETWORK ANALYTICS  

Increased Coverage: Instead of investigating each risk indicator (event), network-based pattern detection allows for prioritization of risk events, thus increasing the monitoring coverage. 
Identify Hidden Relationships: Party relationships can be defined based on tightly or loosely related links. This helps identify hidden relationships at the surveillance layer itself, which may have been missed during investigation.
RiskBased  Scoring  &  Prioritization: Networkbased  multiple  layer  correlation risk  scoring,  not  at  case  level,  but  at  individual  event  and  entity  level  too. 
Holistic Investigation: process  allows  for Since  correlated  entities  and  events  are  linked  and  present case  information, this  allows  for  investigation  from  any  entity  perspective
Enhanced Network Visualization: Now that  relationships  are  identified  and  enriched  leveraging both  internal  and  external  data,  much  more  advance  network  visualization  can  be  used  to  determine bad  entities. 
While this  new  way  of  monitoring means  a  much  more  efficient  AntiMoney  Laundering  and  Anti-Terrorist  Financing  program,  organizations  should  be  careful  about  the  level  of  network  link  to  be  used for  correlation.  If not thought through,  this  can  lead  to  a  much  more  complex  case  and  might ‘over help’  investigators.  Appropriate training, future need for  delinking ,and  information  sharing  between analytics  and  Financial  Investigation  Units  should  be  considered  when  getting  into  this  new  program. Lastly, the  subsequent  phase  would  be  to  apply  machine  learning  to  identify  new  hidden  relationships, statistical  techniques  for  scoring  and  determine  case  promotion  threshold  based  on  historical information.

Network analytics is the future of AML

Network analytics has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of AML programs. In practice, statistics from a network (for example, how closely it resembles a known money-laundering typology) would be incorporated into existing customer-risk rating and transaction monitoring models as inputs to improve model accuracy. New capabilities such as community detection would help accelerate investigations and identify hidden risks.
Network analytics takes time to get right and can require an enormous amount of computational power to sift through all current and past customer relationships. Historically, uniquely identifying a customer across systems to build links was also quite difficult. But this has changed over the past three to five years as banks have invested heavily in data infrastructure and built unique customer identifiers that are shared across systems. Scalable infrastructure (for example, Hadoop, AWS) has also provided institutions with more storage and computational power—enabling new use cases including network analytics.
Start by building a network of existing customer links by using account transfers, shared account ownership, and payments to build linkages both internally and to external institutions using the destination account number. Then create inferred links between customers by looking at shared addresses, employer, or social media data. Although often the target state, an enterprise grade graph database is usually not required—data can be stored in a standard relational database to get started. Even without advanced analytics, creating this database of links will accelerate investigations and provide data scientists with a rich asset that can be used for AML, in addition to a wide variety of other use cases (for example, marketing).
To take full advantage, most institutions will need to build capabilities in network science as the tools may be unfamiliar to even experienced data scientists. This will unlock a significant opportunity to improve both customer risk rating and transaction monitoring. The secrets to success are having the right external data sources and network science capabilities, and using deep subject matter expertise to inform model development.
